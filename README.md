**Business Financial Data Model**

🚀 Overview

Welcome to the Business Financial Data Model! This project is all about predicting the likelihood of small retail businesses repaying their loans. We use self-declared financial data collected via KoboToolbox surveys, focusing on daily sales and revenue as key indicators.

🔄 How It Works

We take raw business survey data and transform it into insights using machine learning. Here's the flow:

📥 Data Ingestion – Collecting raw survey data.

🛠️ Data Cleaning & Validation – Handling missing values and ensuring consistency.

📊 Feature Engineering – Extracting meaningful business indicators.

🤖 Model Training & Evaluation – Building and testing predictive models.

📈 Prediction – Estimating loan repayment probability based on daily revenue.
